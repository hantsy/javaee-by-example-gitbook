# Java EE 8 By Example

Java EE 8 brings a plenty of new features which are valuable to build modern applications.

I have spent some time on updating myself to the newest Java EE 8 technology stack. This mini book is my learning notes when I refreshed my knowledge to Java EE 8. It will not cover the existing content in Java EE 7. If you are new to Java EE or need a comprehensive guide of Java EE, I suggest you read the official [Java EE Tutorial](https://javaee.github.io/tutorial/) carefully.

All sample codes mentioned in this book can be found [here](https://github.com/hantsy/ee8-sandbox).

And the source codes of this book itself are also hosted on my github, check [here](https://github.com/hantsy/javaee8-by-example-gitbook).
