# Introduction

Java EE 8 brings a plenty of new features which are valuable to build modern applications.

I have spent some time on updating myself to the newest Java EE 8 technology stack. This mini book is my learning notes when I refreshed my knowledge to Java EE 8. 

## Audience 

I assume you know well about Java 8 and have much experience with Java EE 7. 

This book will not cover the existing content in Java EE 7. If you are new to Java EE or need a comprehensive guide of Java EE, I suggest you read the official [Java EE Tutorial](https://javaee.github.io/tutorial/) carefully.



## About Jakarta EE 8

After  Java EE 8 was released, Eclipse Foundation took over the responsibilities of developing Java EE, due to Java EE regulations, the new Java EE was renamed to Jakarta EE. 

Jakarta EE 8 is the first version published by Eclipse Foundation, the APIs is totally compatible with the previous Java EE 8.  More about Jakarta EE introduction, go to [Kickstart a Jakarta EE 8 application](https://hantsy.github.io/jakartaee8-starter-boilerplate/) for more details.

> In this book, we use Java EE  and Java EE maven architypes through the whole book, all codes are compatible with Jakarta EE 8. 

I also created a repository to collect all useful Java EE 8/Jakarta EE 8 resources, check the latest [Awesome Java EE 8](https://github.com/hantsy/awesome-javaee8) checklist.
