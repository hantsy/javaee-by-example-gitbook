# Java EE 8 By Example

Java EE 8 had been released for a few days, there is plenty of new features added in this version.

I have spent some time on updating myself to the newest Java EE 8 technology stack. 

This mini book is my learning notes when I refreshed my knowledge to Java EE 8. Obviously, it will not cover the existing content in Java EE 7. If you are new to Java EE, I suggest you read the official [Java EE Tutorial](https://javaee.github.io/tutorial/).

## Source codes

All sample codes mentioned in this book can be found [here](https://github.com/hantsy/ee8-sandbox).

And the source codes of this book itself are also hosted on my github, check [here](https://github.com/hantsy/javaee8-by-example-gitbook).

## Online Gitbook

This book will be synchronized to Gitbook, go [here](https://hantsy.gitbooks.io/java-ee-8-by-example/content/) to read it online.

## Contribution

This is an open source book, so your feedback is very important.

If you have some suggestions or find some issues (even grammar errors, I am a non-English guy), do not hesitate to file an issue on [Github issues](https://github.com/hantsy/javaee8-by-example-gitbook/issues) or send a pull request directly.
