# JSF 2.3

JSF 2.3 is a maintained release, and a lots of small features are added. 

Compare to the previous 2.2, more effort focus on aligning with CDI specification. The advantage is more easy to use JSF with CDI in a Java EE 8 application, the disadvantage is the deeply integration with CDI will close doors to other DI container, such as Spring, you have to be stick on a old version.
