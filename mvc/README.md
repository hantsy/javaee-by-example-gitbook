# MVC 1.0

**Update**: Unfortunately the Java EE export group decided to move MVC out of Java EE 8, and now it becomes a community based specification, more details please check the [JSR 371 specification page](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=371).

~~MVC is a new specification which will be introduced in Java EE 8~~ \(MVC is not part of Java EE 8 \).

MVC is based on the existing JAXRS specification.

In the [Spring4 Sandbox](https://github.com/hantsy/spring4-sandbox/), I provided a simple **task board** sample to demonstrate Spring MVC with Apache Tiles, Thymeleaf, Freemarker etc.

In order to introduce the features of MVC 1.0, I will try to port this sample and use Java EE 8 MVC to re-implement it.
